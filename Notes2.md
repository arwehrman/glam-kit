Things to do:
- figure out why See Items and See All Items needs to be pressed twice initially
  for items to show
- Determine if the table format is the way to go for both Index and Show items
- Create JS Object Models
  - Serializers already created
  - mapped out JS Objects just need to implement them
  - create Prototypes probably use them as formatters
  - should I added Handlebars?
- Render form and submit form dynamically
  - which forms? Add? Edit? All?
  - which pages?
  - how to show newly add items in table?
- add more seed data so can implement pagenation?
- Update README file
- why is the Delete action Are You Sure prompt asking twice?
